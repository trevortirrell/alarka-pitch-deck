            The Alarka Micro Resort site is a unique combination of serenity and proximity. Tucked along 350 feet of private creek frontage, yet just 12 minutes from downtown Bryson City, the location offers both seclusion and access. Guests will be able to unwind in a luxury nature setting while still enjoying coffee shops, breweries, and train rides just minutes away.
